an educational multimedia box



HOORCH is a multimedia box for primary school students. HOORCH is a dialect saying that means something like "listen up!".
It consists of a Raspberry Pi 3A+ , 6 RFID-Readers, a microphone, speakers and several LEDs and buttons. It is housed in a laser cutted box with a transparent board top.
We currently have 6 games:
* a storytelling game, where kids can record stories which are then stored for their specific character
* a calculating game
* a game for learning english animal names
* an animal voice guessing game
* an animal orchestra game for learning the animal voices
* a game for learning the parts of a modern instrumental song (e.g. bass line, hi-hat, snare, kick, melody)

Folders:
